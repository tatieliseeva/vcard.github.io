    <h2>Simulations</h2>
    <img src="assets/simulations.jpg" width="300" height="220">
    <p>
      Non-linear processes are very difficult to tackle analytically and quickly tend to be overwhelming when trying
      to
      understand them. That tasks can appear in structural analysis, heat transfer or mass transport, nuclear
      medicine.
      Profound knowledge regarding statistical process simulations (for example with Monte-Carlo methods) or finite
      element methods (FEM) allow us to take on such challenges as well.
      <br />
      Having parameters of your task, we can estimate how the whole system is going to behave or restore the important
      missing information.

    <p>
      Does your organisation has collected quite some data and you wander what profit may be made out of it? Have you
      ever be thinking about a possibility to use the information for gaining new customers or to optimise your
      business? Or maybe to solve a technical problem?
      <br />
      We can help you.
      <br />
      We will provide you the insights about correlation, distributions and behaving the objects of interest to
      empower
      your decision making. Or to get an inspiration for a new product or service.

      Not sure about how the new product is accepted by public? Wandering what the concurrence is up to? Need to know
      the values of the young generation in order to target them?
      <br />
      We offer you information scrapping facilities: it means in short time you will get complete overview of public
      mentions from many platform, including social networks, of the topic of interest.

    <p>
      Visual recognition is a powerful instrument of automation. It may help to improve the quality control or to
      automate counting and sorting procedures on production facilities. Image analysis can also be used for many
      various fields, diagnostics or microscopy as example.
      <br />
      We can either deliver you a ready-to-implement API, or to set up a fully integrated recognition system.

    <h2>Computer Vision</h2>
    <img src="assets/simulations.jpg" width="300" height="220">
    <p>
      We can strategize, design and build a state-of-the-art Machine Learning engine in the cloud, wrapped by an API
      server and another layer of UI for your automotive self-learning AI/ML solutions. For instance, we assist you to
      diagnose patients accurately based on their medical records (e.g. patient complaints, symptoms, CRT images, etc)
      dynamically and let the application learn constantly.
      <br />
      We can help you make a sentient text analysis tool or a virtual dialog emulator by using a deep language
      processing model and or implementing the state-of-the-art generative models.
